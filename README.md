### Devilman Crybaby
Despite it's art and gory visuals, the story and characters made the series so much heartwrenching to watch. Especially the scene where Maki was chartered to pieces and impaled in sticks while the killers celebrated... my heart sunk because it was unexpected since typical animes tend to have plot armor but it isn't the case here. 

### Amagami SS
A generic school romance anime with different routes that leads the MC with different beautiful girls. As they say, you like what you don't have :'> 

### Danshi Koukousei No Nichijou
This anime is what my school life would have been back in grade 12 if the pandemic didn't hit... Anyways, this anime is just about a group of boys' shenanigans and a slice of life anime about their daily lives.
